# Wins & Challenges
## Wins
Additional features include:
* Scoring system based on the popularity of a post, determined by its emoji count
	* More popular posts are placed higher in the feed
* Good server-side data verfication. Posts are not allowed if they don't have a title or body, or if the title and body are too long
	* Errors are displayed individually if there are multiple errors
	* All HTML tags are converted to ampersand character codes before being saved so HTML injection cannot occur
