Started by planning the features and work to be done
Initially we focused on prototyping and getting the backend working first:

Added some CSS files to style the website
Tested the features and the code

Then we fixed up the frontend and got it looking nicer:

# Wins & Challenges
## Wins
Additional features include:
* Scoring system based on the popularity of a post, determined by its emoji count
	* More popular posts are placed higher in the feed
* Good server-side data verfication. Posts are not allowed if they don't have a title or body, or if the title and body are too long
	* Errors are displayed individually if there are multiple errors
	* All HTML tags are converted to ampersand character codes before being saved so HTML injection cannot occur
## Challenges
Using git for the team work
Dynamic card generation system posed a challenge to modifying the cards. Difference between static HTML and dynamic JS manipulation of elements
Testing
Strict equality of types vs coerced equality
DRY and WET code
## Future features:
Password hashing, 
Push notifications
More emojis
Security questions
Search option
